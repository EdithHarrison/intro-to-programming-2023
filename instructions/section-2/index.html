"About"

Hi there! My name is Edith, but my family and friends call me Nene. 
I'm an immigrant from the Philippines and moved to the United States 6 years ago. 
In the Philippines, I worked in the accounting industry for over 5 years. 
When I moved to the United States, I was lucky enough to start working at a community college. 
As an employee, I was offered the amazing opportunity to take classes for 3 credits per semester. 
So, I decided to take some web designing classes. During my time in those classes, 
I found myself completely fascinated with programming. I was even able to build my own website using HTML and CSS! Unfortunately, 
I wasn't able to finish the whole course due to some family situation changes, 
but I am determined to go back and relearn all of that knowledge. 
That's why I'm so excited to be here in Code a Dream!
